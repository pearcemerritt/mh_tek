define a txn object:
    a timestamp
    an amount

define a total object that has
    the following fields:
        an end time
        a list of txns in day before end time
        a sum of txn values
    and the following methods other than getters/setters
        add a txn

total object add txn method(txn)
    set the end time to the txn time
    add the txn value to the existing sum
    add the txn to the end of the list of values
    for each txn in the list
        if the txn time is older than a day before the new end time
            subtract the txn value from the sum
            remove the txt value from the list
        otherwise, end the loop

identifyFraudulentCards(txns, threshold)
    create an empty map of hashes to total objects
    create an empty set of card hashes

    for each txn string
        parse the string into a txn and a card hash
        if card hash is already in the set
            skip itr
        add the card hash to the map if not already
        add the txn to mapped total object
        if the mapped object has an amount over threshold
            add the card hash to the set

    return card hash set
